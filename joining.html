											<h2>Joining the Project</h2>
											<h3>A network of independent sites</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Grassroots Internet Project is a loose network of independent organisations and sites local to Manchester. There is no need to officially join, and you should only do so if you wish to support the project.
										</p>
										<p>
											This site can and does link to organisations that haven't joined, and may even link to sites such as instagram for groups without a dedicated site. However, joining helps the project by allowing it to be discovered and used by your audience, and is always appreciated.
										</p>
										<p>
											The following are a list of guidelines for organisations wishing to join:
										</p>
										<h3>
											Be Independent.
										</h3>
										<p>
											This site is a hub of small and independent organisations, and to join your site must be an independent, grassroots organisation that isn't funded by major corporations or sponsors. 
										</p>
										<h3>
											Have a Site.
										</h3>
										<p>
											Your site doesn't need to be fancy or have anything more than a series of links; a linktree or blog is enough.
										</p>
										<h3>
											Link back Here.
										</h3>
										<p>
											The project works best when groups help and support each other, and intends to act as a hub for discovering other groups around Manchester. Linking back to it helps it grow. You may also want to link to other groups similar to your own, to help them grow too.
										</p>
										<h3>
											Get in Touch!
										</h3>
										<p>
											If you have a group that you believe follows these guidelines and would benefit from joining the project, let us know! Once you do, we can add your group, or make it official if you're already listed.
